# Web-Game: Milestone Project 1

## Main Concept
This is a web game that combines HTML, Javascript and CSS. It is a shiba themed matching games. There is 12 cards and you have to match 6 pairs of them in order to get a score. You would simply click on one card and then click on the second one to see if they match. If they are not, you will have to open another pairs until you found a pair that have the same images. The design and the theme of this game is from my friend's shiba. 

### Functionl Pieces
This game has two shiba background. One of the image is repeated so it covers partial of the background and if you look at the bottom of the game, there is a score that keep track of our points as well as the time. It will tell you how much score you got and how many time you are spending in the game.

### outstnading bugs or unfinished functionality
Having a timer that would stop user playing the game after a certain time. a much nicer backgrond as well as better style effect. I believe there is still more improement that i can make it the code better. But it takes time to practice and practice. I have seen that people can creat a flashing background and adding background music to the game.
